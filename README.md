Hacksaathi is an innovative platform designed to streamline the process of finding hackathon teammates. With just a simple search like "I am looking for <domain/skill>", Hacksaathi instantly matches you with people who have the right expertise. Unlike traditional platforms, you don’t need to know names or have connections—just search and connect.

We successfully tested the platform by hosting a hackathon at our college, and now it’s ready for a broader audience. To experience it, use the following credentials:
